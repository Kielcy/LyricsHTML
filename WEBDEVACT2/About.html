        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I’m Charles Christopher B. Organista, a 22-year-old Computer Science student who’s also navigating the
            challenges of being a working student.
            <br> Balancing academics, work, and personal passions isn’t easy, but I’ve
            always believed that growth comes from pushing myself beyond my limits.
        </p>
        <p>Writing has always been a big part of who I am. As a former Editor-in-Chief of a college publication at Don
            Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (DMMMSU),
            <br> I had the privilege of using my words to inform, inspire,
            and create meaningful conversations. My time in publication taught me the importance of responsibility,
            leadership,
            <br> and staying true to my voice. Even though I’m now focusing on my studies in tech, my love for
            writing hasn’t faded, it continues to shape how I think and communicate.
        <p>Juggling work and studies is tough, but I see it as an opportunity to build discipline and resilience. There
            are days when exhaustion hits, but my goals keep me going. 
            <br>I want to excel in Computer Science, not just for
            a degree but to develop skills that will open doors for me in the future.
