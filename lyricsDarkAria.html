    <p> [Intro]</p>
    Dark time has come <br>
    To pack away all the joys <br>

    <p>[Verse]</p>
    You don't wanna hear my apology <br>
    Get it off my chest <br>
    I would do my best <br>
    I know what you fear <br>
    Similarities we possess <br>

    <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
    Never will I pass the test <br>
    The scene is fading <br>
    Can my soul be put to rest? <br>

    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    Death is gonna come from me <br>
    Be the change I couldn't be <br>
    Can you find a life that's like fairy tales? <br>
    Far from this tragedy <br>
    Sad you had to wait for me <br>
    Feels like an eternity <br>
    Please, forgive me for my sins <br>
    Angels wings lifting and setting me free <br>

    <p>[Instrumental]</p>

    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    Death is gonna come from me <br>
    Be the change I couldn't be <br>
    Can you find a life that's like fairy tales? <br>
    Far from this tragedy <br>
    Sad you had to wait for me <br>
    Feels like an eternity <br>
    Please, forgive me for my sins <br>
    Angels wings lifting and setting me free <br>

    <p>[Post-Chorus]</p>
    The question of my love
    Slipping light through the cracks and crumbling to dust <br>
    The question of my love <br>
    Slipping light through the cracks and crumbling to dust <br>
